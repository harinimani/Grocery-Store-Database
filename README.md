# Grocery-Store-Database
A program that will maintain a small grocery database using linked list data structures.
The data for each grocery item consists of the item universal product identifier (integer), item name (string), the unit cost (double), and a character indicating the product category (i.e., ‘M’ for meat, ‘P’ for produce, ‘D’ for dairy, ‘C’ for canned goods, and ‘N’ for nonfoods).
